    <td>In terms of the spreadsheet, nothing and no knowledge. In terms of my blog, I have a nice looking page with 5 posts already there.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make a spreadsheet for my fruit selling business with little room for human error.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, apart from one area, which I completed at home.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned through watching Mr. Tansley go through the creation of his business. He explained the code he entered to automate certain elements, and I then replicated this in stages. Doing it in stages definitely helped with understanding. I also learned by doing. I had a go at doing different systems using the little knowledge I had, like adding a VAT deduction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited because I had very little time actually doing things in the lesson, and this left me in a position where the whole of my voucher code system was to be done at home. Also once again not knowing much about Google Sheets limited me because I was predominantly reliant on those around me, and what Mr. Tansley had taught the class..</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will know the basics of Sheets and can move through those basic problems considerably easier. I will improve my learning by using all of my past knowledge.</td>
