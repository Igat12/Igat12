  <tr>
    <td>I missed the beginning of the lesson due to mouthguard fitting and therefore was not aware of the instructions. I then used the skill of communicating with others to acquire relevant information and was quickly back on track. I edited my config.yml file by replacing the old, default information with the information that I wanted (name, avatar and description). I searched for my avatar on google images and copied the url. I pasted this into the config.yml file instead of the default picture url. I then experimented with changing the colour, background colour and font. I collaborated with the two people next to me when errors occurred and we shared solutions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A lack of css knowledge hindered me, however with the aid of w3schools.com and those around me I could easily find solutions. I was also hindered by arriving late due to mouth guard fitting because I had to read someone else's notes. I need to work on thinking flexibly and independence, because although we all helped each other, doing more of the problems alone and quickly would allow me to get more done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will look for alternate solutions to problems and try to think more flexibly. This will improve my learning because I can get more done and advance quicker in lessons.</td>
