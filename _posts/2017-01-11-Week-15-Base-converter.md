  <tr>
    <td>I learned by watching and taking in Mr. Keen's tips and tricks on converting, and in doing calculations with binary and hexadecimal. The simplicity of how you can switch between hexadecimal and binary is brilliant. When making the converter I learned by doing in order to find the different functions and use them for all three bases.</td>
