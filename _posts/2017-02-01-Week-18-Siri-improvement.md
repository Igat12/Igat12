    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by seeing Mr. Keen type and go through his code, then taking the first few lines of his code to work with it. This was an effective strategy of visually taking something in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by copying a little too often from Mr. Keen and not figuring out enough of my own errors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will refrain from looking as much as it limited my thought processes. I'll improve my learning by once again adding to my experiences and processes.</td>
  </tr>
