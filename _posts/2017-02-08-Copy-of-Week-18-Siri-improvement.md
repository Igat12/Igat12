    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had my siri clone with some basic questions like age, birthdays etc. and all the python knowledge that came with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Add loops, and create my own functions.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by seeing Mr. Keen type and go through his code, then taking the first few lines of his code to work with it, like last time. This was an effective strategy of visually taking something in, and I learned by building on my knowledge of what a problem may me, and how to solve it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the little time-consuming things like creating loops, that are straightforward but require some time. I need to work on looking at the board less and solving more of my own problems.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I'll improve my learning by once again adding to my experiences and processes, but also by devoting more time to improving.</td>
  </tr>
