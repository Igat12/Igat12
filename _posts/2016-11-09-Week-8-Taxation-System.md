    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Start on a taxation system whereby I could put in any wage and it'll tell me what tax I have to pay.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>Mr. Tansley gave a very detailed talk about the uses and how it works and gave us some of the formula. From there we had to work the rest out ourselves, and there was always going to be issues. I have fine tuned my code and it still isn't working with the taxable amounts subtracting from each other, so that will need fixing at some point.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by time, as after all of the questions and talking little time was left to experiment and work with the formulae. I need to work on thinking about it more than trialling and improving randomly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time hopefully we will have more actual work time but I will know the formulae better and itâ€™ll simply be a matter of fixing my errors and making it work rather than physically building the main body of the system.</td>
