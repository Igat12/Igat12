    <td>Mr. Keen initially gave us text to read for the basics. This was a skill of taking in the information and using it in future. We next solved a simple code where letters were substituted with different ones. This encompassed basic problem solving. We were then told to create a presentation about research into the similarities in the history of encryption. I decided to make a Prezi.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was immediately limited by virtually no prior knowledge to apply! I also had forgotten a large amount of how Prezi worked so I couldn't do as much research because of the time spent re-learning it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will know the basics of how the topic works and I will have my Prezi ready to used. I will improve my learning by being able to act on tasks quicker with my newer knowledge.</td>
