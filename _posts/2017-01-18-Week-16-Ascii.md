    <td>Mr. Keen instructed us to research a table of Ascii conversions. Here I learned independently, and by using given resources. After he briefly explained the concept, we began to make our sheets. I learned using prior knowledge of the "vlookup" function on Sheets to make mine work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the large quantity of time that we spent on the interesting topic of light, and what colour really is that was sparked at the front. This limited me in terms of this topic, but not in the grand scheme of life!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by knowing more about how Hex, Binary and Denary can be used in concepts like Ascii.</td>
  </tr>
