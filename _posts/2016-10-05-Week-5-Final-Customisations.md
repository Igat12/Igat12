    <td>I began by sourcing an appropriate background image, which suited my blue theme. Once I'd found a visually appealing one, I copied the image url. I then used W3Schools to discover the correct code to use for putting the image as my background. After that, I used the aid of W3Schools once more for a guide on fonts. I changed mine to a more appropriate one, and inspected the page again for a solution for my previous colour issue, even after collaboration and the help of W3Schools, I still haven’t fixed this (where it says "Blog" and “About” at the top).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by my need for a good background. I spent too long sourcing one, and with the benefit of hindsight, it was probably procrastination. I could work on this by searching more specifically than “Blue Background”. Attention to that kind of detail would be a habit to work on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will spend less time on the details (and probably sort those at home if I need to) and focus on the more long term, and more crucial problems. There will be a new area of focus next week so this style.css area will be relegated to home only.</td>
