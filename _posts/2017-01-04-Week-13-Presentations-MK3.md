    <td>My presentation was re-designed for the third time, and I'd added notes for Mr. Keen to work with.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Get areas for improvement from Mr. Keen.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Each pupil's presentation was shown and read by the class and teacher. It was then graded (taking into account the speaker notes) and handed back. I learned by others’ mistakes and things that were successful. I got a 7/9, which I’m pleased with seen as a 9 was virtually impossible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by once again not being able to completely present it. I couldn't portray it actually as I intended it to be. I need to work on conveying that better in the speaker notes, but it was better than last week where they didn't exist at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my portrayal of how I want to say/ read things in speaker notes. I will also make the areas that were highlighted as 'key phrases’ clearer. I’ll also add specific boxes for each key area in my Prezi.</td>
