    <td>Mr. Keen spent virtually the entire lesson on the board, drawing tables with the system. He then explained the system, and then the techniques that were used to convert to denary and so on. Then we were set questions on conversion (and for homework). I have learned visually, through explanation, and through practise.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by my slower than average mental arithmetic because of the holidays! This made each individual calculation time-consuming as a consequence.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I'll have firstly re-learned the system of binary, but will also have settled in again and hopefully my brain will be more engaged. Also Iâ€™ll have practised and picking it up again will be considerably easier.</td>
