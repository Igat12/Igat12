    <td>My page was up and running well, with a lot of customisations.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The lesson didn't happen due to enrichment day, so I just tried to improve my page at home.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes for some things, not for others.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I changed the colours of most of my headers that I previously wasn't able to change. However, I attempted to change two, and even after inspecting the elements on my actual page to see what headers they were, I failed to change their dull grey. Using my prior knowledge of knowing easily how to change colours aided my progress as they took a very short amount of time each.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not knowing more advanced ideas on CSS inhibited me because I couldn’t change certain headers, even after inspecting, and being more familiar possibly would have solved the problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will probably not have as much freedom next lesson, because we will be moving into more specific ground and therefore there isn’t much I can improve, other than in my understanding of how CSS, and making my page works.</td>
  </tr>
