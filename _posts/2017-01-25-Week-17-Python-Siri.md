  <tr>
    <td>I learned by doing, and visually. Mr. Keen talked through the functions, variables and the basics of Python again, however we spent a large part of the lesson building our siri clone. The doing part made me learn from my mistakes and errors in my code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact we had to go over basics, as I didn't exactly learn as such, but I refreshed. I could have covered more new functions in that time rather than just ones like print().</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by not making those little errors and mistakes again in my code. I will also be completely back on par of what I could do on Python after the refresher.</td>
