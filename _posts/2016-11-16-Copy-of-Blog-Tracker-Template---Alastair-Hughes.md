  <tr>
    <td>I listened to Mr. Tansley going through the criteria and then gave myself a 6.
I next discovered that Gihub had forgotten a lot of my changes, including my background. I tried to edit this and find issues but discovered none worked. I even tried taking a previous version from history and replacing my new one with it and this confirmed it was a github issue.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that I couldn't really add to my blog was very limiting and hopefully Github will get out of its twist.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will hope it is fixed and I will aim to edit HTML to qualify for levels 7-9.</td>
