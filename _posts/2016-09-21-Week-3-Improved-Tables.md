  <tr>
    <td>I quickly picked up how CSS tables worked, as W3Schools had all of the information that I required. This enabled me to change the table colours, borders, padding etc. I edited their code once I understood it, thus improving my CSS knowledge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lack of prior knowledge limited my learning, as I knew little about how CSS worked and was working with W3School's information. I was also limited by my lack of creativeness and ideas to experiment with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to think outside the box (no pun intended) and get some more ideas. I will have improved massively at the start of next lesson because Iâ€™ll have some more knowledge under my belt.</td>
  </tr>
