(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I watched their presentations, learning from their speech, and displays. They had their flaws and benefits  which I could incorporate or learn from.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by not being able to perform mine and learn from that, as it would be more specific to me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time (or on my second Prezi) I have added more of the key terms (I already had some) and I know how to link things in my presentation better.</td>
