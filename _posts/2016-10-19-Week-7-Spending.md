    <td>I took inspiration from Mr. Tansley's Sheet. What rapidly caught my eyes was his spending and costs tab. It contained all the initial investments, with running costs, rent and staff hiring/payment information. I looked at his rent costs and rapidly decided Iâ€™d start on a stall! I looked up a good van to transport my goods and then added that to my costs. I also hired two members of staff etc. I googled some other investments, like a market license.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I initially knew nothing about market stalls, or running them and it was therefore necessary for me to spend time researching them. This decreased my spreadsheet time as a consequence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have all my investments and will aim to crack my profits and tax tab of my sheet. I will change my research because I was stabbing in the dark this week and more specific research will save more time.</td>
