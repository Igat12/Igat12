    <td>I watched Mr. Keen go through the processes and then emulated what he did on my machine. This involved creating a Github account with my Challoner's Google account, and choosing a sensible username (I used Igat12). Then, I searched for 'barryclark jeykll’ and forked it, creating my own version. After this I installed the Gabriel plugin for Docs and could then publish my work. My tester run worked and I then started to write this.
Strategies that proved effective were paying attention and memorising what Mr. Keen said because otherwise I’d end up unnecessarily nagging others for information. I used the DCGS learning habits of Active Listening and Keeping Track for retaining information and assessing what point in the steps I am.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not writing every detail down limited my learning because I could have completed the tasks a little quicker with some detailed notes. For example, on the name of the Url. I need to be resourceful by using my iPad to take notes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will write the specifics on notes and speed up what I do. This could save me time at home because I can get more done in the lesson. With me doing my blog in the lesson, it will enable my blogs to be of a higher quality because they will be fresher in my mind.</td>
