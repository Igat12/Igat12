    <td>The vast majority of the lesson was listening to Mr. Keen talking to the class about effort and work ethic. That was a very effective strategy as I'm sure we all took a lot away from it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn’t actually get to perform my speech, which was limiting because I don’t know where I could improve yet. However I did learn I needed to add a doc with my speaker notes on due to Prezi’s limitations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I’ll have a google doc ready for marking with so Mr. Keen can see my additions to the presentation. I’ll improve my learning by continuing to complete homework the night I get it.</td>
